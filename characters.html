                                        settled in a human village when Hilda was seven. She loved village life, and

                                    <p><strong>Race:</strong> Water Genasi</p>
                                    <p><strong>Age:</strong> Mid-Fourties</p>
                                    <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Mira is a striking figure, her blue-green skin
                                        carrying a faint luminescent sheen that reflects the light in a way that always
                                        seems slightly otherworldly. Her eyes, a brilliant shade of sea foam green, are
                                        perpetually alert, often scanning the horizon. Mira’s short, dark teal hair is
                                        swept back and often wet, giving her an effortlessly windswept appearance. She
                                        wears practical studded leather armor that’s seen years of use, and her favored
                                        short bow rests at her side, ready for action.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Mira is level-headed, observant, and reserved.
                                        She’s known for her calm under pressure and her ability to make quick, sound
                                        decisions, which has earned her the trust of her crew. While she’s generally
                                        quiet and direct, Mira is fiercely protective of those she cares about and will
                                        risk herself without hesitation if it means protecting her ship or her crew. She
                                        possesses a dry sense of humor that she only shares with those closest to her,
                                        and her gaze holds an intensity that speaks to her inner resolve.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Skills and Abilities:</strong> Mira is a natural navigator, with a strong
                                        knowledge of currents, weather patterns, and survival techniques. Her Water
                                        Genasi heritage allows her to stay calm and capable underwater, making her
                                        highly effective in both river and coastal environments. In addition to her
                                        navigational prowess, Mira is skilled in tactics and guerrilla-style combat,
                                        able to leverage her Swarmkeeper abilities to control a situation or create
                                        strategic diversions.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Role in Community:</strong> As the captain of the Glimmerwind Mira is not
                                        really a part of the community. Her only ties here are her relatively close
                                        friendships with the Deepwater family. And her close working relationship with
                                        Hilda.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Mira’s family operated a modest trade fleet along the
                                        coast, and she spent her childhood learning the skills needed to navigate and
                                        survive on the open water. When her family lost their business due to a
                                        political dispute, Mira struck out on her own, using her skills to captain
                                        various vessels until she could afford her own. The *Glimmerwind* is the
                                        culmination of her hard work and dedication, and she’s fiercely protective of it
                                        and its crew. Mira’s reputation as a skilled and fair captain has made her
                                        well-respected among river traders and feared among bandits.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Interactions:</strong> Mira’s sloop, the *Glimmerwind*, is both her pride
                                        and her sanctuary. It represents her life’s work and holds immense sentimental
                                        value. She oversees its maintenance personally, ensuring everything is in
                                        working order, from the rigging to the ballistae. Her crew knows that even the
                                        smallest crack or frayed rope will be met with her swift attention, and slacking
                                        on maintenance is one of the few things that can provoke her temper. The ship is
                                        fast and agile, ideal for trade along the river and coast, and it’s been
                                        specially reinforced for defense against bandit attacks.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Agatha grew up in Anferdale, spending much of her

                                        was young, leaving
                                        her to help run the family business with her uncle. Despite her small-town

                                    <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Brom grew up in a family of renowned blacksmiths with
                                        mixed heritage,
                                        learning the art of smithing from his father, who traveled widely to master his
                                        craft. Inspired by
                                        these stories, Brom traveled in his younger years, honing his own skills before
                                        settling in
                                        Anferdale. He saw the town’s potential and was drawn by the chance to build his
                                        own legacy. Brom’s
                                        sister, Elara, occasionally helps him with the forge, though she spends most of
                                        her time elsewhere
                                        in town.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Interactions:</strong> Brom is a constant presence in Anferdale, known

                                        showing off his
                                        archery skills at the festival, Brom is always engaged with his community. His

                                    <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Thrain is a stocky, muscular dwarf with strong,
                                        calloused hands that bear
                                        the marks of years spent working with wood and metal. His deep auburn hair,
                                        streaked with gray, is
                                        tied back in a neat braid, and his beard, adorned with small iron and gold
                                        beads, reaches his chest.
                                        He wears a sturdy leather apron over durable clothes, often covered in sawdust

                                    <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Quiet and reserved, Thrain lets his work speak for
                                        itself. He is
                                        meticulous and patient, with a deep respect for craftsmanship and tradition.
                                        Though he rarely shows
                                        emotion, his steady demeanor and occasional twinkle in his eye reveal his pride
                                        in his craft and
                                        subtle warmth toward those he cares about.</p>

                                        from carts and wheels to ornate wooden sculptures. His precision in woodworking
                                        translates into his
                                        skill as an archer, making him a formidable hunter and competitor in local
                                        contests. As a Ranger, he
                                        excels in tracking, survival, and combat, particularly against undead.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Role in Community:</strong> Thrain’s workshop is an integral part of

                                    <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Thrain comes from a long line of craftsmen, though he
                                        chose woodworking
                                        over his family’s traditional blacksmithing. This decision initially
                                        disappointed his father, but
                                        Thrain’s skill and dedication eventually won his family’s pride. He developed
                                        his archery skills
                                        during his youth while assisting his parents in the woods, honing his precision
                                        and patience. Now,
                                        he channels these skills into both his craft and his role as a protector of the
                                        town.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Interactions:</strong> Thrain is a quiet but steadfast presence in the

                                        frequently collaborates with Brom Vernell on projects and enjoys unwinding at

                                        though he prefers listening to others’ stories over sharing his own. His
                                        occasional gifts of
                                        intricately carved wooden tokens are cherished by friends and neighbors alike.

                                    <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Rowan is a wiry, weathered man with gray-streaked

                                        at the nape of his neck. His face is lined with age, and his hazel eyes hold
                                        both the weight of
                                        regret and the spark of wisdom. He wears simple, practical clothes in earthy
                                        tones, and his sturdy
                                        cloak smells faintly of pine. A polished oak staff doubles as his walking stick
                                        and a symbol of his
                                        faith. Despite his age, Rowan moves with a grace born of his connection to the

                                    <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Rowan is soft-spoken and unassuming, offering

                                        or gentle nudges rather than direct instruction. His humility often leads him to

                                        hidden depths. Though secretive, he remains compassionate and willing to aid
                                        those in need.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Skills and Abilities:</strong> Rowan is a master herbalist and
                                        survivalist, possessing a deep
                                        knowledge of plants, animals, and the land. His ability to read the weather and
                                        terrain is uncanny.
                                        Though his combat skills have diminished, his precision with a staff and his
                                        healing abilities
                                        remain formidable. Rowan’s divine connection to the natural world allows him to
                                        channel its power,
                                        though his confidence in his worthiness sometimes wavers.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Role in Community:</strong> Rowan is a reclusive figure who rarely
                                        ventures into Anferdale,
                                        yet he is respected as an elder and an authority on nature. Though he has
                                        refused a seat on the town
                                        council, his advice is sometimes sought in times of need. Many regard him as a
                                        mysterious guardian
                                        of the woods and its secrets.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Little is known of Rowan’s past, but his deep
                                        knowledge of distant lands
                                        and intricate rituals hints at a life beyond the forests of Anferdale. He has
                                        lived alone for many
                                        years, tending to the forest and its creatures. Rowan’s solitary existence and
                                        reluctance to speak
                                        of his past only add to the air of mystery surrounding him.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Interactions:</strong> Rowan is slow to trust, but those who earn his
                                        confidence find a
                                        wealth of wisdom and guidance. His practical knowledge of survival and nature is
                                        invaluable, and he
                                        can serve as a mentor or ally for those who respect the natural world. When
                                        asked
                                        about his past he often simply refuses to speak.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Race:</strong> Human</p>
                                    <p><strong>Age:</strong> Late Twenties</p>
                                    <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Eoric is a tall, lean man with sharp features and
                                        meticulously styled
                                        dark brown hair. His piercing hazel eyes are often narrowed in disdain, and his
                                        finely tailored
                                        clothing reflects his family’s wealth. He often wears studded leather armor
                                        polished
                                        to a shine, more
                                        decorative than practical.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Arrogant and entitled, Eoric believes his family’s
                                        wealth and status
                                        place him above the common folk of Anferdale. He has a quick tongue for insults
                                        and an inflated view
                                        of his own abilities. While outwardly charming when it suits him, his disdain
                                        for others often slips
                                        through, especially when he feels slighted.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Skills and Abilities:</strong> Eoric’s archery skills are the product of
                                        extensive private
                                        tutoring arranged by his father. However, his lack of discipline and
                                        overconfidence prevent him from
                                        reaching his full potential. He is skilled in persuasion and deception, often
                                        manipulating others to
                                        his advantage.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Role in Community:</strong> As the eldest son of Arlen Greenfield, Eoric
                                        represents his
                                        family in public events and competitions, often flaunting his wealth and
                                        privilege. Though disliked
                                        by many, his influence is undeniable, and few dare to openly challenge him.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Eoric grew up in the lap of luxury, never wanting for
                                        anything. His father
                                        ensured he received the finest education and training, hoping to mold him into a
                                        capable heir.
                                        However, Eoric’s arrogance and lack of work ethic have made him more of a
                                        liability than an asset.
                                        His father’s frequent interference, including bribing competitors and judges,
                                        has only reinforced
                                        Eoric’s belief in his own superiority.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Interactions:</strong> Eoric is a frequent participant in local archery
                                        contests, where his
                                        inflated ego and underhanded tactics often create tension. He is quick to boast
                                        of his wealth and
                                        status, especially when trying to gain favor or intimidate others. While he
                                        often clashes with
                                        people in town, his position as Arlen Greenfield’s heir ensures he is
                                        tolerated—at least, for now.</p>
