              <h2>Overview of the Coastal Conflict</h2>
              <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 years<br><strong>Belligerents:</strong> Gatharion vs. Marathport</p>
              <p><strong>Cause:</strong><br>
                The Coastal Conflict began as a minor incident but quickly spiraled into a full-scale war. A fishing vessel from 
                Marathport was seized by Gatharion's Navy Guard, accused of illegally fishing in Gatharion's waters. The ship, 
                its crew, and its haul were taken as compensation, sparking outrage in Marathport. Diplomatic efforts failed, 
                and tensions erupted into open warfare along the southern coasts.

              <h2>Theaters of War</h2>
              <p>The conflict was fought primarily across two key fronts:</p>
              <h3>The Coastal Waters</h3>
              <p>Naval skirmishes dominated the early years, with both sides vying for control of fishing lanes, 
                trade routes, and coastal outposts. Gatharion's superior naval fleet initially gave it an edge, 
                but Marathport's smaller, faster vessels often disrupted supply lines and outmaneuvered larger warships.
              </p>
              <h3>The Coastal Lands</h3>
              <p>Raids and small-scale battles erupted along the southern coastline. Both sides sought to destabilize 
                each other by targeting fishing villages, ports, and inland trade routes. The <a href="#" class="text-warning" 
                data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" data-bs-target="#crimsonBandCanvas" aria-controls="crimsonBandCanvas">Crimson Band</a>, 
                hired by Gatharion, played a notorious role using guerrilla tactics to sow chaos in Marathport's territory.

              <h2>Key Turning Points</h2>
              <h3>The Siege of Oceanfall Warf (Year 3)</h3>
              <p>Gatharion’s attempt to capture a key Marathport encampment ended in disaster. Marathport’s defenders 
                used terrain and weather to force Gatharion into a costly retreat.
              </p>
              <h3>The Crimson Band's Atrocities (Year 5)</h3>
              <p>Under Yardun "The Terrible" Rasgar, the Crimson Band targeted civilian populations. These atrocities 
                soured public opinion in Gatharion and caused unrest within its ranks.
              </p>
              <h3>The Battle of the Shoals (Year 6)</h3>
              <p>Marathport’s navy dealt a critical blow to Gatharion, sinking a significant portion of their fleet. 
                This marked the start of Gatharion’s decline.
              </p>
              <h3>The Dismissal of the Crimson Band (Year 7)</h3>
              <p>Under pressure, Gatharion disavowed the Crimson Band, leaving its forces disorganized and vulnerable.</p>

              <h2>Aftermath</h2>
              <p>By the eighth year, both sides were weary. Marathport gained the upper hand after the Battle of the 
                Shoals, but it was Gatharion’s internal crisis that ended the war. The sudden death of King Artheon V 
                plunged Gatharion into chaos, forcing a withdrawal and paving the way for the <strong>Treaty of the Azure Straits</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>The treaty redrew maritime boundaries and included reparations. Marathport emerged with naval supremacy 
                intact, while Gatharion entered a period of political unrest under young Prince Haldric. Economic damage 
                was significant for both sides, though Marathport recovered faster. The Crimson Band, now disavowed and 
                leaderless, splintered into rogue factions before reorganizing into a criminal enterprise.

              <h2>The State of Gatharion: 15 Years After the Coastal Conflict</h2>
              <p>Gatharion has spent 15 years rebuilding. Though trade routes and infrastructure have recovered, the 
                memory of the treaty with Marathport still stings. Internal factions call for renewed action against 
                Marathport, testing King Haldric’s leadership. Meanwhile, the <strong>Grand Church of the Flame Eternal</strong> 
                grows bolder, providing aid but also seeking greater influence. High Flamekeeper Aldred’s ambitions threaten 
                to rival the throne’s authority.
              </p>
              <p>Haldric now faces mounting pressures from hawkish nobles who resent Marathport’s prosperity, and from 
                a church whose power and moral authority rise with each passing year. The threat of renewed conflict with 
                Marathport and internal strife looms large, forcing the king to navigate a precarious path or risk another 
                era of turmoil.

    <h4>Origins and Early Days</h4>
    <p>The Crimson Band began over a millennium ago, not as a group of brigands, but as an elite mercenary 
        company. Founded by the infamous sellsword Kaedor "Redblade" Alveric, the band earned its name from 
        its blood-red banners and Kaedor’s grim tradition of staining his blade with the blood of his enemies 
        after every contract. Renowned for their discipline and effectiveness, they fought for nobility and 
        merchants alike, bound only by loyalty to gold rather than ideals.</p>
    <h4>The First Fall</h4>
    <p>Under the leadership of Durvek Tarn, the Band’s honorable roots were abandoned. Contracts to terrorize 
        civilians, pillage towns, and assassinate nobles replaced their once-principled work. These dishonorable 
        tactics tarnished their reputation, and by the end of Durvek’s reign, the Band was a disorganized rabble 
        of thieves and murderers. Facing relentless persecution from kingdoms across the region, the Crimson 
        Band fractured and faded, their name nearly forgotten.</p>
    <h4>The Rise of Yardun "The Terrible" Rasgar</h4>
    <p>Generations later, Yardun Rasgar, a brutal lieutenant of Gatharion’s army, resurrected the Band. 
        Recruiting disgraced soldiers and criminals, he rebuilt them into a paramilitary force fueled 
        by discipline and cruelty. During the Coastal Conflict, Yardun’s tactics of sabotage, arson, 
        and assassination terrorized Marathport and destabilized the region. His unrelenting brutality 
        earned him the moniker "The Terrible."

        However, Yardun’s recklessness ultimately led to his downfall. His atrocities alienated Gatharion’s 
        allies and turned public opinion against him. Branded a liability, he was disavowed by the crown, 
        hunted, and eventually captured. His hanging marked the Band’s second fall.</p>
    <h4>The Reforging Under Grimjaw</h4>
    <p>The Crimson Band’s story could have ended there, but Grimjaw, a charismatic and cunning half-ogre, 
        stepped into the void. Grimjaw reorganized the Band into a criminal syndicate, abandoning its 
        military roots. No longer a disciplined force, they became a network of raiders, smugglers, 
        and brigands, profiting through extortion and fear.

        Grimjaw introduced new tactics, embedding operatives in villages and cities to sow dissent 
        and gather intelligence. This shadowy evolution allowed the Band to survive and adapt, 
        becoming a persistent threat throughout the region.</p>
    <h4>The Modern Era</h4>
    <p>Today, the Crimson Band operates as a ruthless criminal organization under Grimjaw’s 
        iron rule. However, cracks 
        are forming within their ranks. Grimjaw’s increasingly cruel methods have begun to 
        divide the Band, with some members questioning his leadership. Whether these 
        internal tensions will lead to the Band’s downfall or its transformation 
        into something even darker remains uncertain.</p>
