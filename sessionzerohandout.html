              <p>
                Anferdale is a quaint, secluded village nestled along the shore
                of a large, serene lake fed by a nearby waterfall. Though modest
                in size, Anferdale boasts a picturesque landscape with gently
                rolling hills, fertile farmlands, and fishing docks where locals
                cast lines and set nets.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is an ancient wall that stands to inhuman height and spans
                the gap between the mountain ranges that run to the ocean on
                either side of the river. Most of the townsfolk rely on farming
                and fishing for their livelihoods, making Anferdale feel both
                self-sufficient and deeply connected to the surrounding natural
                environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The townspeople are largely close-knit, with a few influential
                families that hold sway in local affairs. Anferdale is governed
                by a city council and safeguarded by a small but competent town
                guard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the families in town or those who live on nearby farms
                have deep ties to this area. They hear news about the outside
                world long after the events have come to pass. Those who live in
                the area have rarely lived elsewhere, and those who move to the
                area find this an ideal location to settle down and sometimes
                start a family.
